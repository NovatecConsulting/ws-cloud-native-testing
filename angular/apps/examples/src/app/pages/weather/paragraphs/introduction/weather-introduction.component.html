This page is tested using basic testing techniques. As we do not want to write unnecessary code, we use the library
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-mocks" target="_blank">ng-mocks</a>
to mock components, services and so on. Feel free to play with it a little and inspect the code for showcases on how it is tested.
